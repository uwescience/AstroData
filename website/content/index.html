    <p>
      AstroData Hack Week is a week-long summer school / hack week / unconference focused on astrostatistics and data-intensive astronomy.</p>

    <p>The mornings will be a typical summer school format, with lectures and exercises covering essential skills for working effectively with large astronomical datasets. The afternoons will be entirely unstructured, and offer opportunities for collaborative research, breakout sessions on special topics, and application of the concepts covered during the morning sessions.</p>

    <p>The vision is to provide a space to encourage learning, research, collaboration, and sharing of expertise, for the benefit of both young and experienced astronomical researchers alike.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Hack Week Wiki</h2>

    <p>See our <a href="https://github.com/uwescience/AstroData/wiki">github wiki</a> for up-to-date information on scheduling and planning, including a partial list of who will be attending and what they plan to work on!</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Registration</h2>

    <p>This will be a relatively small event; we have space for about 40 people. Registration is <b>$50 per participant</b>, which will partially offset the costs of running the workshop.</p>
    <p>We have reserved a block of rooms at the <a href="http://www.universityinnseattle.com/">University Inn</a>, a short walk from campus; the conference rate of $149 (single or double occupancy) is available first-come first-served.</p>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>

    <p>
    Each day will consist of <b>morning sessions</b> devoted to learning
    fundamentals of computational astronomy, and <b>afternoon sessions</b>
    devoted to unstructured research, hacking, and collaboration,
    with the potential
    for informal breakout sessions on special topics of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will be making use of the textbook <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10159.html"><i>Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy</i></a> by Ivezić, Connolly, VanderPlas, and Gray. It is not required, but we encourage you to bring a copy if you have it!
    </p>
    <p>
    The following is an initial draft of the schedule; there will likely be
    modifications made in the weeks leading up to the conference.

    <p>
      Because of the unique and unstructured nature of this hack week, we
      suggest that you come prepared! Come with a project in mind, with data
      to explore, with a colleague to collaborate with. This should not be a
      week away from work, but a week to try some new approaches to your
      current research topic!
