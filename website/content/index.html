    <p>
      AstroData Hack Week is a week-long summer school / hack week /
      unconference focused on astrostatistics and data-intensive astronomy.
      The vision is to provide a space to encourange learning, research,
      collaboration, and sharing of expertise, for the benefit of both
      young and experienced astronomical researchers.

               "<p>David W. Hogg is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at New York University. His main research interests are in observational cosmology, especially approaches that use galaxies (including our own Milky Way) to infer the physical properties of the Universe. He also works on exoplanet measurement and discovery. In both areas, he is interested in developing the engineering systems that make these projects possible, for his group and for the astrophysics community as a whole. His research is supported by New York University, NASA, the NSF, and the Humboldt Foundation.</p><p>Hogg is working towards several comprehensive projects in observational astrophysics, including the measurement and simultaneous analysis of every galaxy (above some mass) in the observable Universe, every star (above some brightness) in our Galaxy, or every image (above some quality) taken by any astronomical camera. The comprehensive goals are long-term goals, but he is involved in present-day projects that work towards them, including Astrometry.net, Gaia, NYU-VAGC, and SDSS-III.</p>") }}

His main research interest is observational cosmology using gravitational lensing: weighing galaxies, and measuring the expansion rate of the Universe. He is involved in a number of surveys to find new lenses, using both ground-based and space telescopes - including designing the strong lensing science analysis for LSST.</p><p>Like all astrophysicists Marshall works in the low signal to noise regime, where information is at a premium and prior knowledge inevitably becomes important at some stage: developing probabilistic methods for data analysis is a continuing theme in his work.</p>") }}

He continues to lead the IPython project along with a talented team that does all the hard work.  He is currently a research scientist at the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, focusing on the development of new tools for scientific computing and data science, drawing from problems in brain imaging and other disciplines.</p><p>Perez regularly lectures about scientific computing in Python, and is a member of the Python Software Foundation as well as a founding board member of the Numfocus Foundation.

    <h2>Schedule</h2>

    <p>
    Each day will consist of <b>morning sessions</b> devoted to learning
    fundamentals of computational astronomy, and <b>afternoon sessions</b>
    devoted to unstructured research, hacking, and collaboration,
    with the potential
    for informal breakout sessions on special topics of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
    The following is an initial draft of the schedule; there may be slight

    <p>
      Because of the unique and unstructured nature of this hack week, we
      suggest that you come prepared! Come with a project in mind, with data
      to explore, with a colleague to collaborate with. This should not be a
      week away from work, but a week to try some new approaches to your
      current research topic!
