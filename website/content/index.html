    <p>
      AstroData Hack Week is a week-long summer school / hack week /
      unconference focused on astrostatistics and data-intensive astronomy.
      The vision is to provide a space to encourange learning, research,
      collaboration, and sharing of expertise, for the benefit of young
      and experienced astronomical researchers alike.

    <h2>People</h2>
    <p>The following folks have been involved with planning this event, and will be helping to facilitate the morning sessions:</p>

    <div class="bio">
      <img src="media/images/ivezic.jpg" align="left" height=150>
      <p><b>Željko Ivezić</b> is a professor of astronomy at the University of Washington. His research interests are in detection, analysis and interpretation of electromagnetic radiation from astronomical sources.  He is lead author of <i>Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy</i>, a graduate textbook for data-intensive astronomy. He serves as the Project Scientist for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope project and currently chairs the American Astronomical Society's Working Group on Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio">
      <img src="media/images/hogg.jpg" align="left" height=150>
      <p><b>David W. Hogg</b> is a professor of Physics and Astronomy at New York University. His main research interests are in observational cosmology, especially approaches that use galaxies (including our own Milky Way) to infer the physical properties of the Universe. He also works on exoplanet measurement and discovery. In both areas, he is interested in developing the engineering systems that make these projects possible, for his group and for the astrophysics community as a whole. His research is supported by New York University, NASA, the NSF, and the Humboldt Foundation.</p>
      <p>Hogg is working towards several comprehensive projects in observational astrophysics, including the measurement and simultaneous analysis of every galaxy (above some mass) in the observable Universe, every star (above some brightness) in our Galaxy, or every image (above some quality) taken by any astronomical camera. The comprehensive goals are long-term goals, but he is involved in present-day projects that work towards them, including Astrometry.net, Gaia, NYU-VAGC, and SDSS-III.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio">
      <img src="media/images/marshall.jpg" align="left" height=150>
      <p><b>Phil Marshall</b> is a staff scientist at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, at SLAC, Stanford University. His main research interest is observational cosmology using gravitational lensing: weighing galaxies, and measuring the expansion rate of the Universe. He is involved in a number of surveys to find new lenses, using both ground-based and space telescopes - including designing the strong lensing science analysis for LSST.</p>
      <p>Like all astrophysicists Marshall works in the low signal to noise regime, where information is at a premium and prior knowledge inevitably becomes important at some stage: developing probabilistic methods for data analysis is a continuing theme in his work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bio">
      <img src="media/images/vanderplas.jpg" align="left" height=150>
      <p><b>Jake VanderPlas</b> is the Director of Research in the Physical Sciences at the University of Washington’s eScience Institute, where his research is primarily in the area of novel statistical approaches to datasets from astronomy and other fields. He is co-author of the graduate-level text, <i>Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy</i>, and is a maintainer and/or frequent contributor to many scientific open source Python projects, including SciPy, Scikit-learn, astroML, and others. He occasionally blogs about Python, machine learning, scientific visualization, open science, and related topics at <a href="http://jakevdp.github.io">Pythonic Perambulations</a>.</p>
